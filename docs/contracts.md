# Contract Registry

Architecture Frozen v1.0 — authoritative Contract Registry.

The registry is the canonical source for cross-layer contracts. Duplicate or shadow registries are forbidden.

## Registry record schema

Each contract record MUST contain:

```yaml
contract_id: "<stable-snake-case-id>"
version: "<SemVer>"
owner_layer: "<layer>"
allowed_consumers: ["..."]
forbidden_consumers: ["..."]
signature: "<typed-signature-reference>"
async_mode: "ASYNC|SYNC"
error_taxonomy: ["..."]
idempotency: "<declared-semantics>"
timeout: "<declared-semantics>"
rate_limit: "<declared-semantics>"
provenance: "<required-fields>"
tests: ["..."]
status: "ACTIVE|DEPRECATED|RETIRED"
```

## Initial contract baseline

| contract_id | owner_layer | status | verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| ingestion_provider_boundary | ingestion | ACTIVE | G04_ARCHITECTURE_DEPENDENCY |
| market_data_event | domain | ACTIVE | G03_UNIT_CONTRACT |
| provenance_metadata | evidence | ACTIVE | G03_UNIT_CONTRACT |
| temporal_event_boundary | temporal | ACTIVE | G07_INTEGRATION_RESILIENCE |
| validation_result | validation | ACTIVE | G03_UNIT_CONTRACT |

These baseline IDs establish the registry namespace. Implementations MUST bind each ID to its actual typed contract before the corresponding behavior is released. An unbound contract is NOT VERIFIED.
