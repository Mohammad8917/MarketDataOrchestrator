## Architecture direction

The repository is developed bottom-up and market-agnostic. Crypto, Forex, and Gold are product targets; provider-specific behavior remains behind ingestion boundaries.

## Canonical rules

- main is the canonical branch.
- Exact-SHA GitHub Actions evidence is authoritative for gate claims.
- Compliance is a guardrail, not the product objective.
- Strategy code does not own risk, cost, decision, or provider I/O.
